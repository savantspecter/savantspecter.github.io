Despite the surge in interest in crypto-currencies over the past year, the community and Wall Street continue to confuse basic aspects regarding financial valuation. 

Herein, I try to establish a framework for discussing crypto valuation. These ideas may be useful in understanding crypto from a trading/investment standpoint. However, the target audience is crypto's developer community. Decisions made by both core and DAPP developers will have long-term monetary policy consequences. A basic understanding of these economics are therefore requisite to the code design process.
